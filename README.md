# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

    One day, a very important person in my life asked me: "what is your job dream? what is stopping you from getting it?". Since that day after a motivated and supporting conversation about pursuing my dream, my interest in coding became a goal in life! This is my first step to getting closed to my dream job.
